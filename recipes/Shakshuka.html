        <li><b>Vegetables:</b> The base of shakshuka is a mix of sauteed onion, bell pepper, and garlic, along with tomatoes (I use a can of whole peeled tomatoes).  </li>
        <li><b>Spices</b>: The simple combination of paprika, cumin, and chili powder imparts incredible flavor. And the aroma instantly takes me back to meandering the spice souks in Cairo and Amman.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs:</b> Surely you know what eggs are?  </li>
        <li><b>Fresh Herbs:</b> A sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley and cilantro not only adds a pop of green, but also adds yet another layer of flavor. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li> Heat olive oil in a large saut√© pan on medium heat. Add the chopped bell pepper and onion and cook for 5 minutes or until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
        <li> Add garlic and spices and cook an additional minute.</li>
        <li> Pour the can of tomatoes and juice into the pan and break down the tomatoes using a large spoon. Season with salt and pepper and bring the sauce to a simmer</li>
        <li> Use your large spoon to make small wells in the sauce and crack the eggs into each well. Cook the eggs for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the eggs are done to your liking. You can also cover the pan with a lid to expedite the eggs cooking.</li>
        <li> Garnish with chopped cilantro and parsley before serving</li>
    </ol>
